# 198- SQS vs SNS vs Kinesis
- SQS
	- SQS consumer pull data
	- Consumers delete data after processing
	- Can enable FIFO to guarantee ordering
	- Can have visibility timeout to handle processing failures
- SNS
	- All subscribers receive same message
	- Data is not persisted
	- Can use fan out architecture (data -> SNS -> SQS)
	- Can use SNS FIFO -> SQS FIFO Queues
- Kinesis Data Stream
	- Parallel streaming via shards
	- Can replay data
	- Meant for real time big data
	- Ordering on each shard
	- Data is retained for so many days (1-365)
	- can us provisioned mode or on-demand mode
