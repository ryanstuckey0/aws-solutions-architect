# 193- Kinesis Data Streams Hands On
- Select type (Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics)
- Select On-demand or provisioned
	- Includes a shard estimator (max shards available is based on account, can request limit increase)
- Provides libraries to produce to data stream- Kinesis Producer Library is a high level library, AWS SDK also available, or Kinesis agent is a stand alone app
- Can also produce to data stream using AWS CLI
- Can also use AWS CLI to read
	- When using CLI, we have to specify shard ID to read from
		- When using Kinesis Client Library, we don't need to specify shard ID
		- Shard iterator type- TRIM_HORIZON means read records from very beginning (i.e. earliest available record)
		- Returns a shard iterator, which is used to read records by making another call with this value passed in
			- Returns batched records, including data (base64 encoded), partition key, etc.
			- Also returns next shard iterator, which we will use next time we consume to ensure we only get new messages
