- We can only SSH into EC2 instance w/ public IP address, not public
	- Unless you are on a VPN
- Public IP will change when you stop and start an instance
	- Private IP does not change
- We can use an elastic IP to keep the same IP address over the stop and start of an instance
	- Need to associate it to an instance and a private IP
- Should release elastic IPs after done using them
