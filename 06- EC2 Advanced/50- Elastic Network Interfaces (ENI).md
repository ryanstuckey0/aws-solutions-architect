- Represent a virtual network card within a VPC
- Each ENI can have following attributes
	- Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
	- One elastic IPv4 per private IPv4
	- One public IPv4
	- One or more security group
	- a MAC address
- Can be created independently of EC2 instances and move them to other EC2 instances
- Each ENI is bound to 1 AZ
- Good for failovers- if EC2 instance is accessed by private static IP but it fails, then the ENI can be moved to a healthy EC2 instance ![[Pasted image 20240624180437.png]]
