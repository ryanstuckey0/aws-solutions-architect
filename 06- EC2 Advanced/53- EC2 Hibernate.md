- A couple options for EC2 instances
	- Stop- data on disk (EBS) is kept intact
	- Terminate- data is destroyed
	- Hibernate- in memory/RAM is preservered
		- Instance boots much fast
		- Internally, the RAM is written to EBS (for this EBS volume must be encrypted)
		- On startup, RAM is loaded from EBS
		- EC2 instance behaves like it was never stopped
		- Use case: good for long running processes, boot fast
- Good to know
	- Support lots of different instance types
	- Instance RAM size must be less than 150 GB
	- Instance cannot be hibernated more than 60 days
