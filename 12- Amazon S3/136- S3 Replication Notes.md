- After enabling replication, only new objects are replicated
- Need to use **S3 Batch Replication** feature to replicate existing operations
- for delete operations
	- can replicate delete markers from source to target (optional)
	- Deletes with a version ID are not replicated (to avoid malicious deletes)
- No chaining of replications
- **Versioning must be enabled**
