# 135- S3 Replication
- CRR and SRR
- CRR- cross-region replication
- SRR- same region replication
- must enable versioning in source and destination
- buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give IAM permissions so S3 service can read and write for replication
- Use case
	- CRR- compliance, lower latency, replication across accounts
	- SRR- log aggregation, live replication between prod and test accounts
