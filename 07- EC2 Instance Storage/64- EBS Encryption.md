- Encrypting an EBS volume encrypts the following
	- Data at rest inside the volume
	- Data in flight moving between instance and volume
	- Snapshots
	- Volumes created from snapshot
- Encryption and decryption is handled for you
- Negligible impact on latency, so no reason to not encrypt
- Uses KMS (AES-256)
- How to encrypt and unencrypted EBS volume
	- Create snapshot
	- Encrypt the EBS snapshot
	- Create new EBS volume from snapshot (subsequently, volume will also be encrypted)
	- And now attach encrypted EBS volume to original instance
	- Need to select a key from KMS when encrypting
- If a snapshot is encrypted, you cannot create an unencrypted volume directly from it
- Can also create encrypted volume directly from unencrypted snapshot
