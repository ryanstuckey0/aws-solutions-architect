- AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image
- An AMI is a custom image for an EC2 instance
	- Allows faster boot and configuration time from nothing since software, config, etc. is all packaged up already
- AMIs are built for specific regions
	- But can be copied to other regions
- EC2 instances can be launched from AMIs from 3 different locations
	- Public AMI- AWS provided
	- Private AMI- created/maintained by user
	- Marketplace AMI- someone else creates/maintains, and can sell for a price
- Creating an AMI
	- Start and customize an EC2 instance
	- Stop the instance
	- Create an AMI, which subsequently creates EBS snapshots
	- Launch other instances from AMIs
