- EBS volumes are network drives- so they are limited in performance by the network availability
- EC2 Instance stores are physically attached to server
- Provides better I/O performance
- Data is lost whenever an instance is **stopped or terminated**
	- This makes it good for a buffer/cache/temporary data storage
- If the server fails, the instance store will also fail
