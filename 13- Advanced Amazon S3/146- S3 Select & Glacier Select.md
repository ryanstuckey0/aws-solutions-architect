# 146- S3 Select & Glacier Select
- Sometimes we want to retrieve a file, but then we just end up filtering a lot of the data out
- AWS S3 lets us use server-side filtering to filter the S3 object before we fully receive it
- Can filter w/ simple SQL statements
- Used less network, and saves money for client
