# 205- ECS Auto Scaling
- Auto scale # of ECS tasks
- Can scale on CPU, memory, or request count / target from ALB
- Can also set up target tracking, step scaling, scheduled scaling
- ECS Service Atuo Scaling (task level) != EC2 auto scaling (EC2 instance level)
	- Because of this, using Fargate is much easier
- How can we scale EC2 instances in backend?
	- Could use Auto Scaling Group
		- Scale on CPU utilization
	- Or ECS Cluster Capacity Provider
		- Intelligently scales infra based on ECS tasks and the resources they require
		- If you add more ECS tasks and don't have enough resources, then it'll scale EC2 instances
