# 211- AWS App Runner
- Fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy web apps and APIs
- No experience required- start w/ source code or image
- Configure settings- CPU, RAM, autoscale
- AWS will then build and deploy the web app
	- Underneath it will use AWS services
- Auto sets up autoscaling, high availability, load balancer, encryption
- VPC access- so can connect to DB, cache, MQ, etc.
