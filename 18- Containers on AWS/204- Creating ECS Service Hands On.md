# 204- Creating ECS Service Hands On
- Need to first create a new task definition
- Specify name
- Choose where to launch instances- Fargate or EC2
	- Seems tasks creation is independent of ECS clusters
- Specify resource allocations (CPU/memory)
- Specify task role (IAM role)
- Tasks can have multiple containers, but at least one must be marked as essential
	- specify port mappings, env vars, resource limits, logging, but most if okay to leave at default
- Specify storage (21 GB default)
- After creating task, we can go to our cluster and launch it as a service
	- Application type can be service or task- where service is long running (i.e., API server) and Task is a short lived service than runs once then terminates (i.e., batch job)
	- Choose ttask definition- each task instance is a family, and then can choose desired revision from that task family
	- Service type- replica or daemon
- Networking- security group, subnets, inbound rules
- Load balancing- can create new one while making new service
- Can also configure service auto scaling and task placement
- Can launch multiple instances of tasks in same service
	- Application load balancer then kicks in a distributes load between task instances
	- Can scale task down to 0 instances
