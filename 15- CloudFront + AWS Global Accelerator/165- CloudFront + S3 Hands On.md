# 165- CloudFront + S3 Hands On
- Create S3 bucket
- Can use CloudFront to make files accessible w/o making them publi
- Go to CloudFront
	- Notice that it's a global service
- In CloudFront, choose the following
	- origin domain- S3 buckets, ELB, etc.
	- origin path- optional, will append to origin domain name
	- origin access- can choose public (where bucket is public), origin access control (recommended)
		- Can create a new one easily
		- Need to update S3 bucket policy so CloudFront can access bucket
