# 151- S3 Encryption Hands On
- Default encryption- SSE-S3 is auto-enabled
- Editing objects creates a new version of object with updated encryption settings
- Can also override encryption settings at the object level
- When enabling SSE-KMS
	- Need to choose KMS key, or create a new one
	- If you use the default S3 key for the service, it will not cost any money
- After enabling, can see new version of file created
- Encryption settings can also be changed at the bucket level post-creation
	- When using SSE-KMS, can also enable Bucket Key, which uses an S3 Bucket Key to lower calls to KMS (enabled by default)
- SSE-C can only be done from CLI, not web console
- Client side encryption also can't be enabled console (because of the nature of it)
