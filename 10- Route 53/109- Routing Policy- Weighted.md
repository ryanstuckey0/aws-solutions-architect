# 109- Routing Policies- Weighted
- Control the % of requests that go to each specified resource
- Can add weights to each resource, don't have to all be same value: ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240706133305.png)
- Weights don't need to sum up to 100
- DNS records must have same name and type
- Can be associated with health checks
- Useful for load balancing between regions, testing new application version (with small percentage of requests)
- Set weight to 0 to stop sending requests
- Or if all weights are 0, then treats it like a simple routing policy (all records return by DNS server)
-  Create multiple records with same name, set policy to weighted, and specify weight
