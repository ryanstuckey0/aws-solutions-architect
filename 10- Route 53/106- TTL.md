# 106- TTL
- TTL = time to live
- DNS with resolved IP will also return TTL, which tells client how long to cache result for
- Higher TTL = less traffic to DNS server, but also possible outdated records
- Lower TTL = more traffic to DNS server, more cost for customer
	- Useful if you are changing records a lot
- TTL is mandatory for each DNS record, except alias

## Using TTL in Console
- Add record, set IP, set TTL
- Can use `dig` and `nslookup` commands to see how hostnames resolve
	- Also, `dig` will show updating TTL for records: ![](attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240706130651.png)
