# 226- API Gateway Hands On
- When creating new gateway, can choose API type (REST, HTTP, WebSocket)
- Can create new one, import (from OpenAPI), clone existing, or from an example
- Need to select endpoint type- edge, regional, or private
- Once API is create, need to create methods first
	- Method type- HTTP verbs
	- Choose integration type- Lambda, HTTP, Mock, AWS Service, or VPC links
	- Choose region, service
	- default timeout is 29 seconds (max)
	- Auto grants API gateway the right to invoke lambda function- check in permissions for Lambda function
	- Can test Lambda function right from web console
- API Gateway will pass information onto the Lambda function
- Can create new resources (new paths in request)
	- Within each resource, we can then add requests for each of the standard HTTP methods
- Must deploy API gateway before it can be used outside of AWS console
	- Need to select stage (similar to env?)
