# 216- Lambda Hands On
- Lambda auto scales as there are more requests coming it; it will just spin up another instance of the running code for each request coming in
- When creating a function, can choose to create it from scratch, use a blueprint, or a container image
- Can choose to create a new IAM role
- Looks like event info being sent in is usually just a JSON document
- After creating code, we can see the runtime as well as memory used
- Available configuration
	- Can adjust memory between 128 MG - 10240 MB (10GB)
	- Can adjust timeout (default is 3 seconds)
- Can also view metrics on how often it gets invoked, memory user, runtime, etc.
	- Can also jump to CloudWatch to view logs
- After making code changes, have to deploy them for it to be active in Lambda
- Can adjust the python version, and the selected function to handle the Lambda request (format is `python_file.function_in_file`)
