# 95- RDS Security
- Support at rest encryption
	- Master and replicas are encrypted using AWS KMS
	- Must be turned on at launch time
	- If master is not encrypted, read replicas cannot be encrypted
	- To encrypt an un-encrypted database, must go through DB snapshot and then restore as encrypted (similar to EBS volumes)
- In-flight encryption
	- TLS-ready by default, clients must use AWS TLS root certs
- IAM Authentication- can use IAM roles to connect to DB (in addition to basic auth)
- Security groups can be used to control network access to DB
- Audit logs can be enabled and sent to CloudWatch Logs for longer retention
