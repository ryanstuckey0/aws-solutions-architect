# 96- RDS Proxy
- Fully managed database proxy for RDS
- Allow apps to pool and share DB connections
- Useful if you have a lot of connections into DB, improving efficiency and reducing timeouts
- Proxy- serverless, autoscaling, multi-AZ
- Reduces failover times by up to 66%
- Supports RDS (MySQL, PostgresSQL, MariaDB, MS SQL Server) and Aurora (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
- No code changes required- just connection string
- Enforces IAM auth for DB
- Never publicly accessible
- Useful for lambda functions- proxy will pool connections for many lambda functions and avoid overloading the DB
