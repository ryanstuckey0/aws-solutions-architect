- scalability- application can adapt to handle greater load
	- vertical- increase resources allocated to each instance
	- horizontal- increase number of instances (aka elasticity)
- vertical scalability
	- common for a non-distributed system (like DB)
	- Limited by hardware
- horizontal scalability
	- good for distributed systems
	- common for web/modern apps
- high availability
	- usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
	- run app/system in 2 data centers (i.e., AZ)
	- goal is to survive a datacenter loss
- What does this mean in EC2?
	- Vertical scaling- changing instance type up and down (scale up/down)
	- horizontal scaling- increase number of instances (scale out/in)
	- high availability- run instances of app across multiple
